	<h1>This is the <span class="ital">best</span> motherfucking website.</h1>

	<p>Really, it is.</p><br/>

	<h2>Seriously, you guys think that a fucking website doesn't need some styling?</h2><br/>

	<p>You probably build websites using vim and feeling hardcore. You think your 4.99KB <bordeau>motherfuckingwebsite</bordeau>(.com) is going to get you some fucking award to put on your damn footer as a link.</p>

	<p>You think your fucking default font is gonna make your website run even on a toaster.</p><br/>

	<p><mark><span class="gras"><span class="souligne">WRONG</span></span></mark>, motherfucker.</p><br/>

	<h2>The best kick-ass website</h2><br/>

	<p>Let me describe the <span class="ital">real</span> perfect-ass website which still has the glory of the past motherfuckingwebsites:</p><br/>

<ul>
	<li>Shit doesn't weigh a ton (in fact it's just 34.97 KB when the 27.83KB cat picture below is removed)</li>
	<li>The page weighs exactly 63.02kB, 93.7% less than the <a href="https://www.google.com">Google home page</a></li>
	<li>Fits on your iPhone 1st gen (although it doesn't work on your damn 16x32 Tamagotchi)</li>
	<li>Looks <span class="ital">almost</span> the same on every screen</li>
	<li>Every asshole that visits this website can use it without any problem <span class="small-caps">well, kind of</span></li>
	<li>It's <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/">accessible</a>, so everyone can enjoy it <span class="small-caps">but not everyone can read this - this text is Ant-Accessible</span></li>
	<li>Shit is <span class="ital">even more</span> legible than the fucking two previous versions - and it also has a cleanish style without looking like an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARPANET">ARPANET</a> website</li>
	<li>Doesn't load massive images or scripts. We should all care about people who still use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_over_Avian_Carriers"> IPoAC</a></li>
	<li>Uses only free and open resources. Like this ass-breaking font called "Open Sans" <span class="small-caps">which btw weighs 15.21kB, wtf</span></li>
	<li>It doesn't load your glorious jQuery or jQueryUI with all their fucking styles and shits. Nor Angular or any other framework. This website is made with plain HTML, CSS3 and JS. Keep it Vanilla!</li>
	<li>Doesn't include any tracking service <span class="small-caps">this website does, but hey, who cares</span></li>
	<li>Images aren't forbidden, but when SVG is available <span class="ital">JUST USE IT.</span></li>
	<li>Use some fucking <div class="couleur">colors</div>.</li>
	<li>Links don't really need to keep that <blue>shitty blue</blue> the browser is giving them: nor that <violet>violetish color</violet> when they are marked as visited. Just give them a <a href="https://www.colorhexa.com/0077aa">nice color</a></li>
</ul>
	<h2>Well guess what, motherfucker:</h2><br/>

	<p>This website is ever better than the last <a href="http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com">guy</a> and the <a href="http://motherfuckingwebsite.com">guy</a> before him.</p><br/>

	<p>Why?</p><br/>

<ul>
	<li>It's over a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS">secure connection</a> - so nobody can spy what we're serving to you (the page might be different for everyone, pshht!).</li>
	<li>It uses one of the most general <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generic_top-level_domain">gTLDs</a> available out there: .website</li>
	<li>It uses the TLD, too: bestmotherfucking.website, check out <a href="https://domainr.com">domainr</a> to do something cool too.</li>
	<li>It uses the kickassing <a href="https://letsencrypt.org">Let's Encrypt</a> CA (don't you see the gorgeous green lock?)</li>
	<li>It runs on <a href="https://www.nginx.com/welcome-to-nginx/">nginx</a>: the best fucking web server instead of Apache Server</li>
	<li>It uses a <a href="https://thebestmotherfucking.website/js/jquery-2.2.4.min.js">custom version</a> of the awesome <a href="http://jquery.com">ultra-lightweight jQuery</a> <span class="gras">/s</span></li>
	<li>It doesn't use a single media query <span class="small-caps">well, not really</span></li>
	<li>It probably doesn't support all the web browsers, but that's the best thing - if the user's browser is outdated he will notice and maybe he will switch from <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/fr-fr/hub/4230784/internet-explorer-help">the crap he uses</a> to a <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/fr/firefox/">much cooler browser</a></li>
	<li>It uses some cool technologies like JavaScript<img src="js.png" alt"logo js" img class="img1"/>,CSS3<img src="css3.png" alt"logo css" img class="img1" /> and HTML5<img src="html5.png" alt"logo html" img class="img1" /></li>
	<li>It supports <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP/2">HTTP/2</a></li>
	<li>It includes a Cache-Control header, so you don't waste your precious bandwidth if you visit the website more than once</li>
	<li>It uses <a href="https://matomo.org">Piwik</a>, a free and Open Source analytics platform (we still love you Google, don't be mad at us)</li>
	<li>It allows universal access from every website via <a href="https://enable-cors.org">CORS</a></li>
	<li>It is <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/accessibility-intro/">Accessible</a></li>
	<li>It's Open Source, freely available on <a href="https://github.com/denysvitali/thebestmotherfuckingwebsite/">Github</a>, and everybody can contribute to it.</li>
	<li>It uses the <a href="http://www.wtfpl.net">WTFPL - Do What the Fuck You Want to Public License</a>, which is pretty clear on what you can and what you can't do:</li>
</ul>
	<h2>Put even less contrast</h2><br/>

		<p>Yeah, a <span class="color-sample"></span> <span class="gras">#444 is cool</span> but a <span class="color-sample"></span> <span class="gras">#454545 is better.</span></p><br/>

	<h2>Size matters, yeah, but don't exaggerate</h2><br/>

		<p>Remember, not everybody is blind, and not everybody wants to read a fucking 2 inches letter on a 27 inches screen, so keep it cool. Don't exaggerate in size, but don't make an ant-compatible text either.</p><br/>

	<h2>Put some pictures</h2>

		<p><img src="cat.png" widht="35O" height=240" alt="A cat, just to keep the context of the website." chat class="flottant"><br/>

		We're not looking at a novel by Stephanie Meyer, this is a motherfuckingwebsite so include some pictures to give a context.</p><br/>

		<p>The website shouldn't be overfilled with pictures, but it should make the user happy while reading your nonsense words.</p><br/>

		<p>You see that fancy cat? He's happy, you should be too.</p><br/>

		<br/>

		<p><span class="small">A cat, just to keep the context of the website.</span></p><br/>


	<h2>Yes, even this is satire.</h2>

		<p>But this doesn't mean you should load your motherfuckingwebsite with shitty animations, instead keep it simple, minify its resources and use images responsibly. Remember the IPoAC users!</p><br/>

	<h2>Epilogue</h2>

	<p>Actually this website was made to follow the trend of the <a href="http://motherfuckingwebsite.com">motherfuckingwebsite</a> and the <a href="http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com">bettermotherfuckingwebsite</a>.</p><br/>

	<p>Despite what was said here they're beautiful and truly among the best websites on the internet (even though this is still thebestmotherfuckingwebsite), so go check 'em out.</p><br/>

	<p>Seriously, follow some of the advice we gave you, they'll "make the web great again"</p><br/>

	<h2>Author</h2><br/>

	<p>This website was created by an annoyed developer that can <a href="https://twitter.com/DenysVitali">be followed on Twitter</a>, <a href="https://github.com/denysvitali/">followed on GitHub</a> or contacted <a href="https://denv.it">here, on his ultra-minimalist website</a></p><br/>

	<h2>Ressources</h2><br/>

	<p>The cat picture was taken from the cool <a href="https://pixabay.com">Pixabay</a> website: check it out, it's really cool and full of CC0 (aka Public Domain) content. The author is <a href="https://pixabay.com/en/users/1899441-1899441/">1899441</a> (seriously? His username looks like my PIN code!), the <a href="https://pixabay.com/en/cat-pets-cat-s-eyes-mieze-dear-451377/">old picture</a> was by <a href="https://pixabay.com/en/users/aloiswohlfahrt-123449/">aloiswohlfahrt</a>, but I had to change it, cause it was too heavy and too cute. You can <a href="https://github.com/denysvitali/thebestmotherfuckingwebsite/issues/new">open an issue on GitHub</a> if you think that this decision goes against the rules of a good looking motherfuckingwebsite.</p><br/>

	<p>Don't worry, it can be read in less than 30 seconds, unless you have some sort of reading disability - in that case, I'm wondering why you're still reading this text. Really. Stop. Please. I mean, seriously. Why are you still reading?</p><br/>
